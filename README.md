# LIBROS - Domestic Library
If you have a lot of books (Novels, Translations, Comics, etc.) in your little domestic or family library, you definitely should have faced the problem of keeping track of them. 
An indexing document might be a solution, but writing down all details in a paper and modifying it every time someone borrows a book does not seem an enthusiastic idea. 

Libros provides the exact answer for the issue of adding, editing, deleting, lending, and accepting back with a single Android application. 
It is only a few clicks and a barcode scanning needed for you to safely lend your books without worrying about losing track of which book was borrowed by whom.

All the main functionalities of Libros are listed here in detail. You can see how easy it is to use this app and how user-friendly the whole process is.
